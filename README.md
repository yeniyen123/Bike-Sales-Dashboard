# Bike-Sales-Analysis (with Interactive Dashboard made via MS Excel)

## Description
I worked on this dashboard during my break to sharpen my Excel skills and get more comfortable with data pre-processing, cleaning, visualization, and analysis. I wanted to challenge myself by working with a new dataset and presenting it in a clear, simple, and interactive way.

## Project Objective
- <a href="https://github.com/yeniyen123/Bike-Sales-Dashboard/blob/main/Bike%20Sales%20Dataset.xlsx">Dataset</a> 
- Utilize Excel features by pre-processing, visualizing, and analyzing bike sales data
- Create a dashboard that is clean, interactive, and easy to interpret
- Derive insights from real-world-like bike sales data

## Questions I Wanted to Explore
- Do income levels influence bike purchasing behavior?
- Which age groups are most likely to buy a bike?
- How does commuting distance affect a customer’s decision to purchase?
- Are there any interesting trends based on marital status, education, or region?

## My Process
- Removed duplicate rows
- Standardized entries (e.g., fixed inconsistent marital status and gender labels using Find and Replace)
- Used a nested IF statement to classify customers into age brackets
- Fixed number formats
- Calculated average income for buyers vs. non-buyers
- Grouped and summarized customer commute distances and age data
- Used slicers for marital status, region, and education
- Designed interactive visuals to make insights more intuitive
- Focused on simplicity, readability, and functionality

- Middle-aged males with higher incomes were more likely to purchase bikes
- Customers commuting shorter distances (0–1 miles) tended to buy more
- More noticeable trends appeared by mixing slicer options based on marital, region, and education status
- Gained more confidence using pivot tables, slicers, conditional formulas, and charts
