# Bike-Sales-Analysis (with Interactive Dashboard made via MS Excel)

## Description
I worked on this dashboard during my break to sharpen my Excel skills and get more comfortable with data pre-processing, cleaning, visualization, and analysis. I wanted to challenge myself by working with a new dataset and presenting it in a clear, simple, and interactive way.

## Project Objective
- Utilize Excel features by pre-processing, visualizing, and analyzing bike sales data
- Create a dashboard that is clean, interactive, and easy to interpret
- Derive insights from real-world-like bike sales data

## Questions I Wanted to Explore
- Do income levels influence bike purchasing behavior?
- Which age groups are most likely to buy a bike?
- How does commuting distance affect a customer’s decision to purchase?
- Are there any interesting trends based on marital status, education, or region?

## My Process
### Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate rows
- Standardized entries (e.g., fixed inconsistent marital status and gender labels using Find and Replace)
- Used a nested IF statement to classify customers into age brackets
- Fixed number formats
  
### Data Analysis
- Calculated average income for buyers vs. non-buyers
- Grouped and summarized customer commute distances and age data
  
### Data Visualization
- Used slicers for marital status, region, and education
- Designed interactive visuals to make insights more intuitive
- Focused on simplicity, readability, and functionality

## Project Insights
- Middle-aged males with higher incomes were more likely to purchase bikes
- Customers commuting shorter distances (0–1 miles) tended to buy more
- More noticeable trends appeared by mixing slicer options based on marital, region, and education status
- Gained more confidence using pivot tables, slicers, conditional formulas, and charts

## Final Thoughts 
This project helped me practice transform raw data into actionable insights. Though simple, tt was fun and fulfilling to see that my interactive dashboard was able to effectively display the insights I wanted to explore. With this, I'm looking forward to applying what I’ve learned to more advanced data projects in the future.
